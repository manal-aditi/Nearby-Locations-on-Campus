This project provides a simple HTML-based frontend to interact with a backend that calculates the shortest path between two campus locations and lists the ten closest destinations from a given point. The underlying algorithm uses Dijkstra's algorithm with hash table optimizations for efficient graph traversal and lookup.

Built for the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, this tool can be used to help students or visitors navigate between buildings or find nearby destinations.
